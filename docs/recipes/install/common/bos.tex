In an external setting, installing the desired BOS on a {\em master} host
typically involves booting from a DVD ISO image on a new server. With this
approach, insert the \baseOS{} DVD, power cycle the host, and follow the distro
provided directions to install the BOS on your chosen {\em master} host.
Alternatively, if choosing to use a pre-installed server, please verify that it
is provisioned with the required \baseOS{} distribution.
