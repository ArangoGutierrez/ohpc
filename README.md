### OpenHPC: Community building blocks for HPC systems.

---

#### Introduction

This stack provides a variety of common, pre-built ingredients
required to deploy and manage an HPC Linux cluster including
provisioning tools, resource management, I/O clients, development
tools, and a variety of scientific libraries.

The compatible OS version for this release and the total number of
pre-packaged RPMs available are as follows:

        CentOS 7.1 - 255 RPMs (Base) / 17 RPMs (Updates)

Note that a detailed list of all available components is available in
the "Package Manifest" appendix located in the companion install
guide document. 

#### Getting started

OpenHPC provides pre-built binaries via repositories for use with standard
Linux package manager tools (e.g. ```yum```). Package repositories are housed
at https://build.openhpc.community. To get started, you can enable an OpenHPC
repository locally through installation of an ```ohpc-release``` RPM which
includes gpg keys for package signing and defines the URL locations for [base]
and [update] package repositories. A copy of the ```ohpc-release``` file is
provided below for convenience. A companion install guide with example
instructions for installation is also available below or in in the downloads
section of the latest
[release](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/releases/tag/v1.0.1.GA).
